# restack-capstone-project
React restack capstone project

#### To run
* Clone the repo with `git clone git@github.com:adetola-ralph/restack-capstone-project.git`
* Run `yarn` to install dependencies
* Create an .env from the template .env.example
* Run `yarn start:dev` to start the application in dev mode

App can be access [here](https://r-capstone-react-project.herokuapp.com/)

#### Enhancement that could be made
* Showing a tooltip when a command is clicked on for some feedback to the user
* Better layout for the categories, the flex used presently expands all the categories on a row if one is longer than the rest
* The search doesn't work as well as I want it to, improvements could be made there
* There's crude authorisation in place, it could be made better by defining role and what those roles could do
* Add user image/avatar
* Improve test coverage
